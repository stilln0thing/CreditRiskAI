Underserved populations often include gig workers, rural residents, and individuals without formal banking history. Their financial behavior is harder to assess using traditional credit scoring due to:

1. Irregular income sources (e.g., freelance or contract work)
2. Limited access to credit products
3. Cash-based transactions with fewer digital records
4. Infrequent or late bill payments due to cash flow gaps
5. Low but consistent mobile recharge or rent payments

New-age credit modeling for underserved groups uses alternative data like mobile recharges, UPI transactions, and utility bill history to better gauge creditworthiness.
