Individuals can improve their creditworthiness by following these practices:

1. Paying rent and utility bills on time
2. Keeping digital payment history (e.g., UPI, wallet transfers)
3. Avoiding multiple loans at once
4. Maintaining consistent mobile recharge behavior
5. Increasing formal income visibility (e.g., using salary accounts)

Institutions can also help by accepting alternative data for loan approvals and using AI-based models to score first-time borrowers or thin-file applicants.
